Phase Zero, born out of an idea that should never have existed, Just an egoistic move. Exactly like a toddler pushing for something they have no knowledge about. what they would be entering. We started PZ with a leap of faith and some ignorance.",

Imagine a little child learning how to climb when faced by a mountain that must be overcome without knowing what is coming next. The mountains of clothing appeared to be impenetrable. We took our first fearful steps with determination, facing the unknown and descending into the depths of the garment mountain, unaware of the incredible experience that lied ahead of us.",

I discovered the hard way how tough it is to represent a vision on a canvas (here: fabric). In our desire for perfection, we kept chasing our thoughts in order to make them a reality. To be honest, it wasn't even close. Anyway, trusting the experience and enjoying seeing a toddler grow was what kept us going.",

As our collection was ready to hit the market, we realized the importance of a standout marketing strategy that would set us apart making a lasting impression.  We thought about doing something unusual and new, but what? People who were same yet different were crucial for creating uniqueness.  Similar to how more batteries produce more energy, more minds generate more ideas. We spent two months filming and arranging just how we would present our art.  A genuinely amazing video was produced as a consequence of the knowledge and creativity that each team member contributed. I suppose that was worth the time.

We were relieved that our childishness we’ll call had paid off. Phase Zero's debut was an extraordinary success, justifying our efforts and increasing our brand's confidence. It was both an artwork and a time of great satisfaction. A minute’s success pays the failure of years.",

It's a beautiful concept to explore and bring attention to the hidden artistic elements in our everyday lives. Moreover, our series emphasizes the subjective nature of art. This series serves as a platform to recognize and appreciate the artistry of our friend Prasanna Neupane who is a singer and a song writer. By providing a space for them to share their creative process, inspirations, and stories, we’re helping to give their art the recognition it deserves. This recognition not only validates their work but also helps to bring it to a wider audience, fostering a greater appreciation for their talents. Overall, our project aims to emphasize that art and artists are intertwined, and both deserve recognition. By shining a spotlight on various artists and their works, we contribute to the appreciation and understanding of art in its diverse forms.",
